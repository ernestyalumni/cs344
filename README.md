Introduction to Parallel Programming class code

# Building on OS X

These instructions are for OS X 10.9 "Mavericks".

* Step 1. Build and install OpenCV. The best way to do this is with
Homebrew. However, you must slightly alter the Homebrew OpenCV
installation; you must build it with libstdc++ (instead of the default
libc++) so that it will properly link against the nVidia CUDA dev kit. 
[This entry in the Udacity discussion forums](http://forums.udacity.com/questions/100132476/cuda-55-opencv-247-os-x-maverick-it-doesnt-work) describes exactly how to build a compatible OpenCV.

* Step 2. You can now create 10.9-compatible makefiles, which will allow you to
build and run your homework on your own machine:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

| ----------------- | :----------------------------- | :-----------: | ----------- | 
| student_func00.cu | `./Problem Sets/Problem Set 1/` | Problem Set 1 | My first attempt before I spent 2.5 months with CUDA C/C++ (about June 2016) |
| student_func.cu | `./Problem Sets/Problem Set 2/` | Problem Set 2 | my solution |
| student_func00.cu | `./Problem Sets/Problem Set 2/` | Problem Set 2 | my solution; has the "naive" gaussian blur method (i.e. from global memory) |
| Makefile | `./Problem Sets/Problem Set 2/` | Problem Set 2 | changed Makefile to run on my Fedora Linux setup (mostly changed gcc to nvcc compiler, needed for `cuda_runtime.h` |
| HW2 | `./Problem Sets/Problem Set 2/` | Problem Set 2 | executable for Problem Set 2 for reference (of a working executable), using the "naive" gaussian blur method (no shared memory).  Results I obtained for running `./HW2 cinque_terre_small.jpg` was `Your code ran in: 1.595616 msecs` on a NVIDIA GTX GeForce 980 Ti, EVGA, for thread block size of 16x16, for 32x32, 1.514528 msecs |


## more on Problem Set 2

My writeup is in [`CompPhys.pdf`](https://github.com/ernestyalumni/CompPhys/blob/master/LaTeXandpdfs/CompPhys.pdf) of the [`LaTeXandpdfs` directory](https://github.com/ernestyalumni/CompPhys/tree/master/LaTeXandpdfs) of the [CompPhys github repository](https://github.com/ernestyalumni/CompPhys) - search for "On Problem Set 2".

For block sizes greater than 32, we obtain an error.  So it appears that for this "naive" gaussian blur (i.e. only global memory), then setting `dim3 blockSize(16,16)` or `dim3 blockSize(32,32)` makes the code run the fastest.
